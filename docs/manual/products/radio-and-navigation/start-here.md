### Basis of a RNS & how it works

![](../../../../static/img/RNS.png)

A Radio & Navigation System, or RNS, is all-in-one equipment that comprises
a communications radio, a navigation radio, an automatic direction finder and a transponder.

Here, these instruments are known as COMM, NAV, ADF and XPDR.

Each one is an individual instrument, managed separately and with its own controls.

The controls are multi-axis knobs with central push-buttons.

The knobs have an inner rim and an outer rim. These select the integer and the decimal part
of the displayed values.

The COMM and the NAV push-button controls swap from standby to active frequencies. These functions are
internaly managed by the RNS. They can be mapped as joystick buttons but they will always perform
the sawp task. By default, these two push-buttons are mapped as joystick buttons 1 (COMM) and 2(NAV).

The ADF and XPDR knob rims select the first two digits and the last two digits of these instruments.

The instruments are fully programmable as well as the backlit colors to enhance experience in an
immersive environment.
