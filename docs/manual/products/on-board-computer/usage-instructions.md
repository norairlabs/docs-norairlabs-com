# Usage Instructions

How to use your OBCS

## Operation

In the day-to-day use, the OBCS doesnâ€™t need any special operations. Use the front panel switch to turn it ON or to Shutdown it.

After shutting down, wait some seconds to turn it back ON, if needed.

## The front panel

### Status LEDs

The OBCS has five LEDs in the front panel. They are, from left to right:

Power LED
  * ON when power is being provided to OBCS and peripherals
    
C-PORT (serial communications) USB activity
  * Flashes while serial transactions progress
    
General peripherals network activity
  * Flashes while comunicating with peripherals, normally after enumerations
    
J-PORT (joystick communications) USB activity
  * Flashes while joystick transactions progress
    
Joystick peripherals network activity
  * Flashes while comunicating with joystick peripherals, normally since power up

### Peripherals interface

Numbered from 1 to 4, these are ports to connect peripherals.

The ports provide signal and power to peripherals in one single connection.

To connect a peripheral, align the white dot present in the male connector
(the black and blue plug, at the end of the peripheral cable) with the port
white dot. Gently, insert the peripheral plug to the port to full extent and
rotate the blue ring clockwise, until it begins to hold, to lock the plug in place.

### Power switch

Slide the power switch up, to the ***Power ON*** position, to turn the OBCS on.

Slide down, to the ***Shutdown*** position, to turn the OBCS off.

After shutdown, wait some seconds to turn it ON again. *Toggling the power switch rapidly may damage the OBCS.*
