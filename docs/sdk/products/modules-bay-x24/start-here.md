A Modules Bay is a peripheral that accommodates NorAirLabs modules, in MBx24 case, up to 24 of
these modules. 

A module is a hardware part with input components, such as switches, and/or output components,
such as LEDs. There are various models and versions for many applications.

The MBx24 features, beyond others, the flowing:
- 32 OUTPUTs to actuate LEDs and other low power devices
- 32 INPUTs to read logical states of switches, buttons, etc.
- 32 VIRTUAL INVERTED CONNECTOR Enhancement, or VICe connectors, to automatically inject
logical states to an INPUT without using hardware.

A VICe connector, as a virtual object, doesnâ€™t exist physically. A VICe is nothing more than a
virtualized connector with an assigned joystick button number, created to mimic the inverted logic
state of a real input connector with the same connector number but with other joystick button
number. This is useful when a simulation software requires two joystick buttons to turn on and off
the same item: one to the ON logic state and another for the OFF logic state. The off logic state may
be created virtually as a VICe with an additional joystick button number, saving a physical
connector although occupying a joystick button number. This may not be an issue when there are
199 more available.

Every time 'ID' expression is used, it refers to ID attributed by enumeration. The MBx24 default ID is 50.
